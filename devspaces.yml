# DevSpaces Cloud Resources
# -------------------------
# Many of the cloud resources your application uses can be provisioned by DevSpaces and exposed
# to your DevSpaces containers as environment variables. Adding configuration to the cloud-resources section
# will result in the cloud resources being instantiated and connection information injected 
# into all of the containers that are part of your DevSpace.
#
# Each cloud-resource has a name, a resource type, and a set of options (may be empty) that are 
# used to create the cloud resource. Each cloud resource will have a defined set of environment
# variables that are injected into all containers associated with the DevSpace. The cloud 
# resource’s name will prefix all environment variables in order to uniquely identify the 
# resource they belong to. 
# 
# The cloud resources currently supported are:
# * Amazon Aurora Databases
#     - resource type: aws-aurora
#     - Options:
#		- engineType:
#  		  Type: String
#  		  Default: pgsql
#  		  AllowedValues: [pgsql, mysql5.6, mysql5.7]
#  		  Description: “Type of Aurora DB instance. Use this values explicitly in `devspaces.yml` or default type will be used if ignored.”

#		- DBPort: 
#		  Default: 3306
#		  Description: TCP/IP port for the database
#		  Type: Number
#		  MinValue: 1150
#		  MaxValue: 65535
#		  Description: "DB port. Can be customized in `devspaces.yml` or default port will be used if ignored."
